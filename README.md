# Tax-management-sydtem
This project introduces a Tax Management System that simplifies
income tax calculation for individuals using Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles. It aims to automate tax
calculations efficiently and provide a user-friendly interface for
inputting financial details. The project's significance lies in its
ability to simplify complex tax processes and educate users about
deductions and tax slabs, while also serving as a template for
future enhancements.
